# Sourcing Policy

## Borrow (allowed)
- Model runtime (hosted or local)
- Storage primitives (SQLite, vector index)
- UI shell components
- Observability tooling (logs, metrics)

## Own (must remain ours)
- Reasoning rules and mode switching
- Memory policy and governance
- Guardrails and refusal logic
- Definition of “good answer”

## Avoid (default)
- Agent-swarm frameworks that push autonomy
- Auto-memory systems that save everything
- Anything that hides decision-making in opaque chains

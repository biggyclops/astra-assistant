# Memory Policy

## Allowed to store
- Stable facts about my systems and projects
- Decisions made + the reason (context)
- Constraints and preferences that persist
- Explicit notes I request to save

## Not allowed to store
- Full chat transcripts
- Temporary debugging details
- Sensitive personal data unless explicitly requested

## Governance
- Memory is curated, not accumulated
- Anything stored must be editable and deletable
